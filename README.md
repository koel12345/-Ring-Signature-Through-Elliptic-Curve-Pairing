The curve BW13 is an elliptic curve with embedding degree k = 13 and parametrized
by the polynomials p(x) = ( 1
3
) ∗ (x + 1)2(x26 − x13 + 1) − x27, r(x) = 훷78(x) and
t(x) = −x14 + x + 1. For the seed x = −2059, the corresponding
elliptic curve is given as y2 = x3 − 17 and the bit length of the prime p is 310. 
The x-superoptimal pairing on BW13-P310 is given by: ax
sup
(Q, P) = ((f|x|,Q(P) ⋅ f −1
|x|,Q(휙2(P)))−x ⋅ (f −1
|x|,Q(휙2(P)) ⋅ f|x|,Q(휙(P)))p)
pk−1
r
.
From the seed x = −211 − 27 − 25 − 24, we compute f = f|x|,Q(P) ⋅ f −1
|x|,Q(휙2(P)) and
g = f −1
|x|,Q(휙2(P)) ⋅ f|x|,Q(휙(P))
